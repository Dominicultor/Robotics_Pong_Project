# Robotics Pong Project

## Introduction
For my robotics project I have decided to make a personalized version of the well-known PONG game. 
It is one of the most popular games of all time, and it offers a lot of versatility for both the hardware and the software implementation.

## Hardware design

### List of components (BOM)
- LCD

### Hardware functionality
The **LCD** is initially responsible with displaying the greeting message (when the board is powered up) and then with the main menu.
The main menu has 4 sections :
- Start game
- Difficulty 
- How to play instructions
- About section
Once the game begins, it is tasked with displaying a countdown, and various messages during the game (such as when scoring/winning a match).

The **Joysticks** are tasked with moving the pong pallets during gameplay. 
One of them will also control all options in the LCD menu.

The **LED matrix** is tasked with displaying the actual game, the ball and 2 pallets. Pallets will be displayed as 3 dots at the edge of the matrix,
the bal will be displayed as 1 dot, appearing in the center at the beginning. Connected through SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)

The 2 **potentiometers** are individually tasked with controlling the LCD brightness and the buzzer tone(frequency).

The **buzzer** is responsible for all the sounds in the game. Small short sounds for scrolling in the menu, or hitting the ball during gameplay.


### Pin configuration

1. LCD:
- pin k -> gnd
- pin A -> paired with a 330 ohm resistor (datasheet) 
- pin D7 -> 2 Arduino (digital)
- pin D6 -> 3 Arduino (digital)
- pin D5 -> 4 Arduino (digital)
- pin D4 -> 5 Arduino (digital)
- pin VSS -> gnd
- pin VDD -> 5V
- pin RS (LCD) -> 7 Arduino (digital) (for register selection)
- pin RW (LCD) -> gnd (Connected to ground for write mode)
- pin E (LCD) -> 6 Arduino (digital)
- pin Vo (LCD) -> middle pin potentiometer (contrast adjustment pin)
- left pin potentiometer -> gnd | righ pin potentiometer -> 5V
We are using pins D4-D7 for 4 bit mode. (D0-D3 are for 8 bit mode).

2. Joysticks:  (Joystick 1 -> brown gnd cable | Joystick 2 -> purple gnd cable)
- pin gnd -> gnd (for both)
- pin 5v -> + (for both)
- Joystick 1:
   - pin vrx -> A0 arduino (Outputs analog voltage based on horizontal joystick movement)
   - pin vry -> A1 Arduino (Outputs analog voltage based on vertical joystick movement)
   - pin SW -> 8 Arduino (digital) (Outputs digital signal when the joystick is pressed down)

- Joystick 2:
   - pin vrx -> A2 Arduino
   - pin vry -> A3 Arduino
   - pin SW -> 9 Arduino (digital)
  
3. LED matrix
- pin vcc -> 5V
- pin gnd -> gnd
- pin DIN -> 10 Arduino (digital) (Transfers data from Arduino to the LED matrix.)
- pin CS -> 11 Arduino (digital)  (Chip select)
- pin CLK -> 12 Arduino (digital) (for data transfer synchronisation)

4. Buzzer
- Positive pin -> paired with a 330 ohm resistor
- Negative pin -> 13 Arduino (digital)
- middle pin potentiometer -> A4 Arduino
- left pin potentiometer -> gnd | righ pin potentiometer -> 5V

To test the functionality of the LCD, I uploaded the following code to the Arduino board:
```cpp
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>
#include <Arduino.h>

// initializing the library by associating the lcd pins with the respective arduino pins that it s connected to
const int rs = 7, en = 6,  d7 = 2, d6 = 3, d5 = 4, d4 = 5, 
LiquidCrystal lcd(rs, en, d4, d5, d6, d7);


void setup() {
  // set up the LCD's number of columns and rows:
  lcd.begin(16, 2);
  // Print a message to the LCD.
  lcd.print("hello, world!");
  
}

void loop() {
  
}
 ```

## Software design
The software is built using distinct sections for:

- **Initialization**: Configuring hardware components and displaying the welcome screen.
- **Game Menu**: Managing menu options and user interactions.
- **Game Logic**: Handling paddle movement, ball physics, and scoring.

## Functionalities
1. Menu System
The menu allows the user to select game options, including starting the game, setting difficulty, and viewing "About" or "How to Play" sections.

Key Functions:

displayMenu(): Displays the main menu.
displayDifficultyMenu(): Handles the difficulty selection submenu.
```cpp
void displayMenu() {
  lcd.clear();
  lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
  lcd.print("> " + menuOptions[currentSelection]);
  if (currentSelection + 1 < menuCount) {
    lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
    lcd.print(menuOptions[currentSelection + 1]);
  }
}
 ```

```cpp
void displayDifficultyMenu() {
  lcd.clear();
  lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
  lcd.print("> " + difficultyOptions[currentDifficulty]);
  if (currentDifficulty + 1 < difficultyCount) {
    lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
    lcd.print(difficultyOptions[currentDifficulty + 1]);
  }
}
 ```
